    <p>A banknote—also called a bill (North American English), paper money, or simply a note—is a type of negotiable
        promissory note, made by a bank or other licensed authority, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were
        originally issued by commercial banks, which were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually
        gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes
        only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank.[1] Commercial banknotes have primarily been
        replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks or monetary authorities.</p>

    <p>
        National banknotes are often – but not always – legal tender, meaning that courts of law are required to
        recognize them as satisfactory payment of money debts.[2] Historically, banks sought to ensure that they could
        always pay customers in coins when they presented banknotes for payment. This practice of "backing" notes with
        something of substance is the basis for the history of central banks backing their currencies in gold or silver.
        Today, most national currencies have no backing in precious metals or commodities and have value only by fiat.
        With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues, coins are used for lower valued
        monetary units, while banknotes are used for higher values.

        Code of Hammurabi Law 100 (c. 1755–1750 BC) stipulated repayment of a loan by a debtor to a creditor on a
        schedule with a maturity date specified in written contractual terms.[3][4][5] Law 122 stipulated that a
        depositor of gold, silver, or other chattel/movable property for safekeeping must present all articles and a
        signed contract of bailment to a notary before depositing the articles with a banker, and Law 123 stipulated
        that a banker was discharged of any liability from a contract of bailment if the notary denied the existence of
        the contract. Law 124 stipulated that a depositor with a notarized contract of bailment was entitled to redeem
        the entire value of their deposit, and Law 125 stipulated that a banker was liable for replacement of deposits
        stolen while in their possession.[6][7][5]

        In China during the Han dynasty, promissory notes appeared in 118 BC and were made of leather.[8] Rome may have
        used a durable lightweight substance as promissory notes in 57 AD which have been found in London.[9] However,
        Carthage was purported to have issued bank notes on parchment or leather before 146 BC. Hence Carthage may be
        the oldest user of lightweight promissory notes.[10][11][12] The first known banknote was first developed in
        China during the Tang and Song dynasties, starting in the 7th century. Its roots were in merchant receipts of
        deposit during the Tang dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of
        copper coinage in large commercial transactions.[13][14][15] During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), banknotes were
        adopted by the Mongol Empire. In Europe, the concept of banknotes was first introduced during the 13th century
        by travelers such as Marco Polo,[16][17] with European banknotes appearing in 1661 in Sweden.

        Counterfeiting, the forgery of banknotes, is an inherent challenge in issuing currency. It is countered by
        anticounterfeiting measures in the printing of banknotes. Fighting the counterfeiting of banknotes and cheques
        has been a principal driver of security printing methods development in recent centuries.

        Paper currency first developed in Tang dynasty China during the 7th century, although true paper money did not
        appear until the 11th century, during the Song dynasty. The use of paper currency later spread throughout the
        Mongol Empire or Yuan dynasty China. European explorers like Marco Polo introduced the concept in Europe during
        the 13th century.[16][17] Napoleon issued paper banknotes in the early 1800s.[18] Cash paper money originated as
        receipts for value held on account "value received", and should not be conflated with promissory "sight bills"
        which were issued with a promise to convert at a later date.

        The perception of banknotes as money has evolved over time. Originally, money was based on precious metals.
        Banknotes were seen by some as an I.O.U. or promissory note: a promise to pay someone in precious metal on
        presentation (see representative money). But they were readily accepted - for convenience and security - in
        London, for example, from the late 1600s onwards. With the removal of precious metals from the monetary system,
        banknotes evolved into pure fiat money.

        The first banknote-type instrument was used in China in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (618–907).
        Merchants would issue what are today called promissory notes in the form of receipts of deposit to wholesalers
        to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions.[13][14][15] Before the use of
        these notes, the Chinese used coins that were circular, with a rectangular hole in the middle. Coins could be
        strung together on a rope. Merchants, if they were rich enough, found that the strings were too heavy to carry
        around easily, especially for large transactions. To solve this problem, coins could be left with a trusted
        person, with the merchant being given a slip of paper (the receipt) recording how much money they had deposited
        with that person. When they returned with the paper to that person, their coins would be returned.

        True paper money, called "jiaozi", developed from these promissory notes by the 11th century, during the Song
        dynasty.[19][20] By 960, the Song government was short of copper for striking coins, and issued the first
        generally circulating notes. These notes were a promise by the ruler to redeem them later for some other object
        of value, usually specie. The issue of credit notes was often for a limited duration, and at some discount to
        the promised amount later. The jiaozi did not replace coins but was used alongside them.
