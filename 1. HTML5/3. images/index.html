        The first banknote-type instrument was used in China in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (618–907).
        Merchants would issue what are today called promissory notes in the form of receipts of deposit to wholesalers
        to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions.[13][14][15] Before the use of
        these notes, the Chinese used coins that were circular, with a rectangular hole in the middle. Coins could be
        strung together on a rope. Merchants, if they were rich enough, found that the strings were too heavy to carry
        around easily, especially for large transactions. To solve this problem, coins could be left with a trusted
        person, with the merchant being given a slip of paper (the receipt) recording how much money they had deposited
        with that person. When they returned with the paper to that person, their coins would be returned.
